42.Immediate Food Delivery II

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

 
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        100.0 * 
        SUM(CASE 
                WHEN d.order_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 
                ELSE 0 
            END) 
        / COUNT(*),
        2
    ) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery d
JOIN (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id
) f
ON d.customer_id = f.customer_id
AND d.order_date = f.first_order_date;
