9.Average Time of Process per Machine


The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

Ans:

SELECT 
    machine_id,
    ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 3) AS processing_time
FROM (
    SELECT
        machine_id,
        process_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END) AS start_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END) AS end_time
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
) AS p
GROUP BY machine_id;
