Return the result table in any order.

Ans:

SELECT
    activity_date AS day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
  AND activity_type IN (
      'open_session',
      'end_session',
      'scroll_down',
      'send_message'
  )
GROUP BY activity_date;
